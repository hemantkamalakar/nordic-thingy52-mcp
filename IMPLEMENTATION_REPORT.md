### Known Issues and Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **LED Breathing Mode** (Non-Critical)
   - Status: Nordic firmware limitation
   - Issue: Breathing mode requires color codes (0x01=RED, 0x02=GREEN, etc.) instead of RGB values
   - Workaround: Use LED constant mode for full RGB control
   - Impact: Low - constant mode provides full functionality

2. **Motion Sensor Configuration** (Feature Enhancement)
   - Status: Requires motion configuration writes
   - Affected: Euler angles, heading, orientation, raw IMU
   - Note: Quaternion sensor works without configuration
   - Impact: Medium - basic orientation available via quaternion

3. **Step Counter** (Minor)
   - Status: Requires device motion to generate data
   - Impact: Low - works when device is moving

4. **Tap Detection** (Expected)
   - Status: Event-based sensor
   - Impact: None - works correctly when device is tapped

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. LED Control Fix
**Problem**: LED writes failing with "Writing is not permitted" error
**Solution**: Changed data format from 5 bytes to 4 bytes to match Nordic firmware specification
**Code**: `bytes([mode, r, g, b])` instead of `bytes([mode, r, g, b, delay])`
**Result**: Full RGB LED control now working perfectly

### 2. Notification-Based Sensor Reading
**Challenge**: Direct reads returned "Reading is not permitted"
**Solution**: Implemented notification-based reading for all sensors
**Impact**: All environmental sensors now work reliably
**Method**: `_read_via_notification()` helper function

### 3. macOS UUID Format Support
**Issue**: macOS uses UUID format instead of MAC addresses
**Solution**: Support both formats (MAC: `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`, UUID: `XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`)
**Result**: Seamless operation on macOS

### 4. Data Parsing Accuracy
All sensor data parsing verified against reference implementation:
- Temperature: `int + dec/100` format ‚úÖ
- Humidity: Single-byte format ‚úÖ
- Pressure: Pascal to hPa conversion ‚úÖ
- Air Quality: 2-byte CO2 and TVOC ‚úÖ
- Quaternion: 30-bit fixed-point format ‚úÖ

### 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Tested on macOS ‚úÖ
- Compatible with Windows (Bleak support)
- Compatible with Linux (BlueZ support)
